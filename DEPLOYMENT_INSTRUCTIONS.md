# AGL Code System - Deployment Instructions

## Problem Identified
Your Telegram bot is working on Render, but the AGL codes are being stored in-memory on your Replit development server. These are separate instances, so codes generated on Render won't work when testing on Replit.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Test on Your Render Deployment (Recommended)
1. Use your Render app URL instead of the Replit development server
2. Generate codes via Telegram bot on Render
3. Test the AGL access on your Render deployment
4. Both will use the same in-memory storage

### Option 2: Add Database Persistence (Production Ready)
To make the system production-ready, we should store AGL codes in your PostgreSQL database instead of in-memory storage.

#### Database Implementation:
```sql
CREATE TABLE agl_codes (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  code VARCHAR(8) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  used BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  ip_address VARCHAR(45),
  user_agent TEXT,
  attempts INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  last_activity TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Option 3: Shared Storage (Advanced)
Use Redis or another shared storage solution that both Render and Replit can access.

## Current Status
- ✅ Telegram bot working on Render
- ✅ AGL access system implemented
- ⚠️ Storage is in-memory (codes don't persist between environments)
- ⚠️ Codes generated on Render only work on Render

## Immediate Testing
To test the system right now:
1. Go to your Render app URL
2. Generate an AGL code via Telegram
3. Try accessing `/agl-access` on your Render app
4. Enter the code you just generated

The code should work because both the generation and validation happen on the same Render instance.
